# same-birthday-probability

Calculating the probability of an event is sometimes dependent on other factors. For instance, in the birthday problem. “What is the probability that two people in a room have the same birthday?” the probability is dependent on the number of people in the room.

## Instructions

1. In data science, probability is often used to simulate scenarios.

The code on the right simulates the birthday problem. Right now the code simulates a room with only 2 people that get random birthdays, and the probability that those 2 people have the same birthday is really low.

Change the number 2 to a higher number of your choosing where it says #Change This Number and run the code.

Is there a match in the simulation? What’s the probability that there would be a match?

Keep changing the number to test out different simulations.
